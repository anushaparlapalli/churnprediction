# churnprediction
I had build an  machine learning model that can predict customer churn based on behavioral,transactional and demographic data.
The goal is to identify customers likely to discontinue a service .
Here 0 represents customers churned and 1 represents customers not churned.
"churn_prediction_input.csv" is my input csv file to train the model 
"churnpredictioncode.ipynb" is my notebook source file where i performed datapreprocessing,Feature engineering,model building,model evaluation used logistic regression,Randomforest classifier,xgboost
"output_churn_predictions.xls" is my output file
